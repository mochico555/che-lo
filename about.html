    <h1 class="mid"> About Us </h1>

      <p class="mid cookie">Here at Che-Lo, the word, “Fresh” is our inspiration for everything. Most of our ingredients are made in-house every day like our beans and meats. We cut our fruits to order    while other items, such as our baguettes, are hand-picked from local shops every morning. Cleanliness is also key </p>

    <h1 class="mid">What does “Che-Lo” mean?</h1>
    	<p class="mid cookie">The word “Che” is directly related to the Vietnamese term that refers to traditional Vietnamese desserts or beverages. “Lo” comes from “Hello” and together, the word is pronounced the same as the Cello instrument which gives off a warm sound.</p>
